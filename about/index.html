<h2 id="whats-certbot">What’s Certbot?</h2>
<p>Certbot is a free, open source software tool for automatically using <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> certificates on manually-administrated websites to enable HTTPS.</p>

<p>Certbot is made by the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</a>, a 501(c)3 nonprofit based in San Francisco, CA, that defends digital privacy, free speech, and innovation.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to add the security and privacy benefits of an HTTPS certificate to your website, you may not need Certbot. Many hosting providers have internal tools to enable HTTPS. Before using Certbot, <a href="/hosting_providers">check if your hosting provider is one of them</a>.</p>

    <p>Certbot is usually meant to be used to switch an existing HTTP site to work in HTTPS (and, afterward, to continue renewing the site’s HTTPS certificates whenever necessary). Some Certbot documentation assumes or recommends that you have a working web site that can already be accessed using HTTP on port 80. That means, for example, that if you use a web browser to go to your domain using http://, your web server answers and some kind of content comes up (even if it’s just a default welcome page rather than the final version of your site). Some methods of using Certbot have this as a prerequisite, so you’ll have a smoother experience if you already have a site set up with HTTP. (If your site can’t be accessed this way as a matter of policy, you’ll probably need to use DNS validation in order to get a certificate with Certbot.)</p>
